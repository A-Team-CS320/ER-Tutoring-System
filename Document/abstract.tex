\chapter{Introduction}
	\begin{section}{Purpose of System}
		The purpose of this system is to be an online tutor for students learning ER diagrams. 
		This learning tool would help teach the students and allow them to create ER diagrams and submit 
		them as assignments. The assignments will be created by the instructor using questions taken from 
		a question bank. The questions will have been created by an author and will include the correct answers 
		and any necessary feedback. Once the student submits an answer to be graded they will be given feedback 
		if incorrect. This helps the students learn from their mistakes. The benefits of this system is that it 
		makes learning and submitting assignments much easier for both the students and instructor.

	\begin{section}{Overview}
		This document will clearly outline the requirements and the system requirements of the ER Diagram 
		Tutoring System. This document should cover all key concepts and fundamental requirements. 
		The requirements should satisfy the standards of the client and provide accuracy in the functionality 
		of the system.
	\end{section}

	\begin{section}{Scope}
		The ER Diagram Tutoring System will contain many features to help both students and instructors with 
		the process of teaching. To use the system a user will have to log in. There will be three different 
		types of users. An author can create, edit, copy, or remove questions from the question bank. 
		They are also able to view any previously made question without changing it. An instructor can 
		make assignments using questions taken from the question bank. These assignments are to be assigned 
		to students in the class. They are also able to view their students and information about their 
		attempts on the assignments. The students are the ones who are taking the class and who the questions 
		are made for. They can view questions, without the answers shown, and need to answer and submit them.
