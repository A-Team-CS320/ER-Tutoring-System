\chapter{Functional Requirements}
\section{Gameplay}
\subsection{FUN-01: Player starts the game from the top of the screen}
\textbf{Description}: The player should begin at the ceiling and accelerate
downward, leaving a few seconds to draw the first platform and begin
playing.

\subsection{FUN-02: The user draws lines to bounce their character upward}
\textbf{Description}: The player must draw line segments to bounce
off of. This is done by swiping your finger on the touch screen or
clicking and dragging with the mouse.

\subsection{FUN-03: The user loses when the avatar falls off the screen or runs
into a hazard}
\textbf{Description}: The player loses by falling off the bottom of
the screen or running into an enemy.

\subsection{FUN-04: Screen moves upward in height during gameplay}
\textbf{Description}: The screen will only scroll up when the avatar
is moving vertically upward. The avatar will not pass the top of the
screen before the screen is readjusted.

\subsection{FUN-05: The avatar will bounce back down off of the bottom of platforms}
\textbf{Description}: If the user collides with a platform through
the bottom, it will pass through without any change in velocity.

\subsection{FUN-06: Side walls are solid}
\textbf{Description}: The avatar can bounce off of the wall to avoid enemies and other hazards.

\subsection{FUN-07: The user has a limited length of line they can draw}
\textbf{Description}: When the player has drawn platforms of combined
length equal to the width of the screen and continues to draw, their previous
drawings are steadily erased. To visualize this, imagine the movements
of the snake in the classic game \textquoteleft{}Snake.\textquoteright{}

\subsection{FUN-08: Power-ups will be activated immediately upon acquisition }
\textbf{Description}: Power-ups will be activated as soon as soon
as the avatar acquires them.

\subsection{FUN-09: The user can pause during gameplay}
\textbf{Description}: At any point during gameplay the user can hit
the pause button allowing them bring up a separate screen menu to
suspend play. This menu does not allow the user to see the gameplay
in order to strategize. The pause menu allows the user to quit the
game, go to the store (loses progress), restart the current game,
and to be able to resume the game. There will be a one-second countdown
when they click resume until the game begins again.

\subsection{FUN-10: Screen never moves downwards}
\textbf{Description}: The screen will only move upwards as the player
jumps and will never move downward to follow the player\textquoteright{}s
fall.

\subsection{FUN-11: The activated power-ups will be displayed on the screen}
\textbf{Description}: A list of the power-ups that are currently activated
(in the form of a row of icons), will be displayed at the top of the
screen during gameplay. These power-ups will be passive only and not
be clickable.

\subsection{FUN-12: Smaller platforms cause the player to bounce higher}
\textbf{Description}: The length of the platform will determine how
much upward acceleration the player gains from bouncing, with shorter
length equaling more bounce.

\subsection{FUN-13: A power-up will be collected when the avatar comes into 
contact with it}
\textbf{Description}: The avatar can pass completely through or just
graze the power-up to acquire it. Any form of contact between the
two sprites will count as a hit.

\subsection{FUN-14: Users receive experience points and coins after each playthrough}
\textbf{Description}: At the end of the game, the user receives experience
points proportional to the height reached and number of enemies slain.

\subsection{FUN-15: The user has a level, determined by total experience points}
\textbf{Description}: Levels are determined by total experience points.

during gameplay every few seconds. The number of enemies is random,
but within a certain range that is actively changing during play. 

\subsection{FUN-17: Difficulty of game increases with height and level}
\textbf{Description}: The range described in FUN-16 is based on the
user\textquoteright{}s level as well as the current height at the
time of generation. As the player gets to higher levels (overall)
and heights (in a playthrough), both the maximum and the minimum of
the range will increase.

\subsection{FUN-18: The user\textquoteright{}s current score will be displayed
on the screen}
\textbf{Description}: During gameplay, the user\textquoteright{}s
current score will be displayed on the screen and updated in real
time to reflect the current playthrough. The user will initially have
a score of zero at the beginning of the game. This score will never
decrease. As the avatar rises and their height increases, the score
in the corner will change. 

\subsection{FUN-19: A drawn line will \textquotedblleft{}materialize\textquotedblright{}
upon completion}
\textbf{Description}: A line will only become solid, and allow the
avatar to bounce, when the user lifts his finger, and the second endpoint
of the line has been established.

\subsection{FUN-20: Lines drawn through an avatar will do nothing}
\textbf{Description}: Regardless of whether or not the user has completed
the line, the avatar will always pass through the line, if the user
has drawn the line through the avatar.
