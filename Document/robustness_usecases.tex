\chapter{Robustness Use Cases}
    \begin{section}{Online Tutor System Should Never Crash}
        Description: Nothing any user does should crash the web browser.  The online tutor system may 
        reach an exception when performing a specific task, but it will never crash the user's browser 
        or machine.  Each online tutor system task exception should be handled.
    \end{section}
    
    \begin{section}{UI Should React Correctly to User Actions}
        Description: The UI should correctly react to what the user's actions command.  
        If a specific user action was not accounted for when the UI was created (the UI does not have the 
        ability to make a response to that action) the online tutor system will reach an exception and that 
        exception should be handled by the UI remaining in its current state.
