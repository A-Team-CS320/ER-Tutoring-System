    \begin{section}{Student Enters Diagram}
     
    Description: The student submits a diagram in either Chen or CF that is correct but is not the same as the instructor’s.\\
    Primary Actors: Student, System\\
    Secondary Actor: Professor\\
    Steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The student enters a diagram into the system.
    \item The system checks the diagram against the professor-submitted diagram(s).
    \end{enumerate}
    
     Successful Post Condition: 
    The system marks the student correct.\\
    Exceptional Conditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The student is unable to submit a diagram as an answer to a question.
            \item The system cannot process the student’s submitted diagram so that it can be compared to the professor’s uploaded answer.
            \item The system cannot send the student a response that says if his/her diagram was correct or incorrect.
            \end{itemize}

    \end{enumerate}
    Successful Post Condition: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system marks the student incorrect.
        \end{itemize}
    Exceptional Conditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The student is unable to submit a diagram as an answer to a question.
            \item The system cannot process the student’s submitted diagram so that it can be compared to the professor’s uploaded answer.

        Secondary Actor: System\\
        Steps:	
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The professor submits an answer into the system.	
            \item The system recognizes that the professor did not submit an answer format.
        \end{enumerate}
            Successful Post Condition: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The system sends a prompt to the professor specifying that the answer was not recorded in the system and that he/she must submit an answer format.

            \item The student or professor clicks buttons/links or drags items from a template to the answer submission.
            \item The system follows the links or correctly places the dragged items in the submission box.
            \end{enumerate}
    Successful Post Condition: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system view refreshes so that the student or professor sees his/her actions take place in real time.

    Exceptional Condition:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A specific student or professor action was not accounted for when the UI was created - the UI does not have the ability to make a response to that action.
        \end{itemize}
